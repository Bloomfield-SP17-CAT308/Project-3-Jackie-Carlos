##### Based on our feedback...
- We should consider how to vary our level design so that the game is not too repetitive.
	- Moving platforms
	- Make dark-gray enemies, make the player start out as gray, and gain color powers to shoot (shoot with the mouse?)
- Add a score/counter of some sort, could be..
	- Numeric points (Ex: Score: 10)
	- Player's color could change towards the colors they picked up
- Add a somewhat-satisfying end game condition
- Player visits a colorless world on death - This could be a cool addition!
	- How could they exit?
	- Could the player "accumulate or loss color power" of some sort?
- Add toggleable controls screen

Carlos:
Currently, we have...
- Player movement with the mouse and keyboard. (Note: Press Ctrl while playing to toggle the mouse mode between moving the cursor and rotating the player)
- Prefabs for the Player, the hazardous Red Spikes, Collectables, and the Walls.
- Player Health system, impacted by walking into red spikey objects (with animation for the player)
- The Collectable objects with rotation and color coordination with the terrain.
- Basic, temporary handling of player death (simple respawn with full health). There is no animation or wait-time for a gameover screen yet.

Some things we need that you can help with:
- We need the map/level to be laid out with more collectable objects, walls, and spikes. You can resize them if you want to vary them a little (with scaling in the Transforms). You can also edit the terrain heights to make hills for example.
- We do need some audio if you can create some for background music, and SFX when the player collects a collectable, runs into a spike, and jumps, perhaps. If you would have to grab audio from somewhere, I can create the sound effects. (Just cause licensing is complicated and I don't want to have to worry about works cited on the screen)
